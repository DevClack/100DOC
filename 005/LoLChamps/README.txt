This project was created simply to test my current understanding of classes, methods, setters and getters. I also wanted to test creating a class outside of the main class file and using it within the main class file. This ensured that I was not missing something obvious somewhere. I did however have some issues with my Eclipse IDE not running the code I was working with. After about an hour and a half of searching this has been chalked up to being a "Eclipse bug"..? HUH? A bug that litterally repeatedly runs an unopened, unselected class file that has nothing to do with the directory or files you're working with...? 
Why on earth is that mainstream?
So I built this with NetBeans IDE. It was okay, a lack of shortcuts and hotkeys definately mean you better remember your formatting, quotations, brackets and parentheses. 
It also had one wierd little issue. Within my getRole method, it ran the first time with a bug, and suggested I set "role" to a string within the method? I used the "helper" menu that popped up to fix the "bug" but it changed not a single thing so I'm not sure what that was about. I haven't run into that in eclipse. 

This is going to be an interesting ride for sure.
