this is the beginning of a series of "diary" entries for this challenge/experience. 
I will be making personal as well as non-personal notes in these entries from now on as needed. They will not be made every time I commit or even every day. I am using these in replacement for actual commit messages for now as I have no reason to have a legitimate "commit message" in this non project repository. 
For reference, the "test.txt" files were uploaded just to create the file tree inside of the github repository and are redundant and unecessary otherwise. 

I am currently working through a series of tutorials to better understand the fundamentals of Java as well as be sure I know the basics before jumping into anything larger. I have plenty of experience getting into "new" things without going through basics first (playing guitar, league of legends, building pc's, fixing cars, etc. ) and this has been a terrible experience for me no matter how much I enjoyed it. So let's get it right this time!

Anyways, I'm hoping that by the end of this series I am capable of commiting actual small projects in this repo instead of tutorial notes. 

*ps. I will considerably cut down on the amount of pushes and commits I make for now, doing so only when moving from my laptop to desktop, or stopping for the day. a commit with every file is a bit much in my opinion.
